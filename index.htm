	<h1> Web Content Accessibility Guideliness</h1>
	<p> <strong>Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)</strong> is developed through the W3C process in cooperation with individuals and organizations around the world, with a goal of providing a single shared standard for web content accessibility that meets the <em>needs</em> of individuals, organizations, and governments internationally.
	The WCAG documents explain how to make web content more accessible to people with disabilities. Web “content” generally refers to the information in a web page or web application</p>
	<h2> Web Content Accessibility Guideliness 1.0</h2>
	<p> Since its founding in 1994 by Web Inventor Tim Berners-Lee, the World Wide Web Consortium has developed the foundational technical standards upon which the Web has flourished. The Web and its place in society have changed dramatically, and the Web Consortium has been at the core of its technical interoperability. Today we need a more dramatic transformation to address the opportunities and threats the Web now faces and to continue to shape its future constructively.
	The Web Content Accessibility Guideliness 1.0 had 14 guideliness and divided them into 3 priority levels: </p>
	<ol>
		<li> Provide equivalent alternatives to auditory and visual content</li>
		<li> Dont rely on colour alone</li>
		<li> Use markup and style sheets, and do so properly</li>
		<li> Clarify natural language usage</li>
		<li> Create tables that transform gracefully</li>
		<li> Ensure that pages featuring new technologies transform gracecully</li>
		<li> Ensure user control of time sensitive content changes</li>
		<li> Ensure direct accessibility of embedded user interfaces</li>
		<li> Design for device independence</li>
		<li> User interim solutions</li>
		<li> Use W3C technologies and  guideliness</li>
		<li> Provide context and orientation information</li>
		<li> Provide clear navigation mechanisms</li>
		<li> Ensure that documents are clear and simple</li>
	</ol>
	<ul>
		<li> <strong>Priority 1</strong> - the most basic level of web accessibility</li>
		<li> <strong>Priority 2</strong> - addressed the biggest barriers for users with disabilities</li>
		<li> <strong>Priority 3</strong> - significant improvements to web accessibility</li>
	</ul>
	<h2> Web Content Accessibility Guideliness 2.0</h2>
		<p> <strong>WCAG 2.0</strong> was published as a W3C Recommendation on 11 December 2008. It consists of
twelve guidelines (untestable) organized under four principles (websites must
be perceivable, operable, understandable, and robust). Each guideline has testable
success criteria (61 in all). The W3C's Techniques for WCAG 2.0 is a list of <strong>techniques</strong> that
support authors to meet the guidelines and success criteria. The techniques are
periodically updated whereas the principles, guidelines and success criteria are stable and
do not change.<br>
The principles of WCAG 2.0 are: <br>
   <ul>
	<li> <strong> Perceivable</strong></li>
	   <p> Information and user interface components must be presentable to users in ways they can
		   perceive. It has 4 guideliness:</p> 
		   <ol>
			   <li>Provide text alternatives for any non-text content so that it can be
changed into other forms people need, such as large print, braille, speech, symbols or
				   simpler language.</li>
			   <li>Time-based media: Provide alternatives for time-based media.</li>
			   <li>Create content that can be presented in different ways (for example
				   simpler layout) without losing information or structure.</li>
			   <li> Make it easier for users to see and hear content including separating
				   foreground from background.</li>
	   </ol>
	<li> <strong> Operable</strong></li>
	   <p>User interface components and navigation must be operable.It has 4 guideliness:</p>
	   <ol>
		   <li>Make all functionality available from a keyboard.</li>
		   <li>Provide users enough time to read and use content.</li>
		   <li>Do not design content in a way that is known to cause seizures.</li>
		   <li>Provide ways to help users navigate, find content, and determine
			   where they are.</li>
	   </ol>
	<li> <strong> Understandable</strong></li>
	   <p>Information and the operation of user interface must be understandable. It has 3 guideliness:</p>
	   <ol>
		   <li>Make text content readable and understandable.</li>
		   <li>Make web pages appear and operate in predictable ways.</li>
		   <li>Help users avoid and correct mistakes.</li>
	   </ol>
	<li> <strong> Robust</strong></li>
	   <p>Content must be robust enough that it can be interpreted reliably by a wide variety of user
		   agents, including assistive technologies. It has 1 guideliness:</p>
	   <ol>
		   <li>Maximize compatibility with current and future user agents, including
			   assistive technologies.</li>
	   </ol>
   </ul>
		<h4>Criticism of WAI guidelines</h4>
		<p> There has been <strong>criticism of the W3C process</strong>, claiming that it does not sufficiently put the
			user at the heart of the process. There was a <strong>formal objection</strong> to WCAG's original claim that
WCAG 2.0 will address requirements for people with learning disabilities and cognitive
limitations headed by Lisa Seeman and signed by 40 organisations and people. In articles
			such as <cursive>"WCAG 2.0: The new W3C guidelines evaluated"</cursive>, "To Hell with WCAG 2.0" and
"Testability Costs Too Much", the WAI has been criticised for allowing WCAG 1.0 to get
increasingly out of step with today's technologies and techniques for creating and
consuming web content, for the slow pace of development of WCAG 2.0, for making the
new guidelines difficult to navigate and understand, and other argued failings.
In Spain, UNE 139803 is the norm entrusted to regulate web accessibility. This standard is
			based on Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0. </p>
